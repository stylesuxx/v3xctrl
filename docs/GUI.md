# GUI
The handling should be self explanatory. Pressing the `[ESC]` button will toggle the Menu.

Keep in mind, that some settings will require a restart of the GUI for them to take effect.

## Debug output
In case the GUI is not working properly, the debug output can be found in the terminal. It will provide information about the current state of the GUI and any errors that occur.

```bash
./v3xctrl-gui --log DEBUG
```
