# GUI
The handling should be self explanatory. Pressing the `[ESC]` button will toggle the Menu.

Keep in mind, that some settings will require a restart of the GUI for them to take effect - this is mentioned next to the according settings.

## Debug output
In case something is not working as expected, the debug output can be found in the terminal. It will provide information about the current state of the GUI and any errors that occur.

```bash
./v3xctrl-gui --log DEBUG
```

> By default the GUI will only log ERRORs and above.
